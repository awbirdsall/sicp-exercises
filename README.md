My work through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

Written within DrRacket using the [`neil/sicp`](http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/neil/sicp.plt/1/17/planet-docs/sicp/index.html) package.

Helpful resources online include [Bill the Lizard's](http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/10/sicp-challenge.html), [JoT's](http://jots-jottings.blogspot.com/p/sicp-exercise-index.html) and [Barry Allison's](https://wizardbook.wordpress.com/solutions-index/) annotated solutions, and [a course page for MIT's 6.037](http://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.S184/) (previously 6.001, *the* SICP course).
