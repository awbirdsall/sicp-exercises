My work through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

Written within DrRacket using the [`neil/sicp`](http://planet.racket-lang.org/package-source/neil/sicp.plt/1/17/planet-docs/sicp/index.html) package.

Helpful resources online include [Bill the Lizard's](http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/10/sicp-challenge.html) and [JoT's](http://jots-jottings.blogspot.com/p/sicp-exercise-index.html) annotated solutions..
